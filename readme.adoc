= Rust Samples

This is an experimental project, trying different frameworks and technics on Rust.

For development, I use cargo with:

```
cargo install cargo-watch
```

```
cargo watch -q -c -w src/ -x run
```

== Todo Rust (rbatis)

A simple Todo Backend API based on
https://docs.rs/actix/latest/actix/[actix]
with https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=ydata-r21[benchmarks]
and based on https://github.com/rbatis/rbatis.
If you look more for a JPA like approach, take a look on https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started.

__Rework:__ Review how to instantiate the TodoService in a correct Rust way.
